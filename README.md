This repository contains binary transciptomic data of NVU cells post ischemic stroke in mice in CSV format.
It also contains json file for analysis of the transcriptomic dataset on UpSet platform for visualizing the intersection of mutiple sets comrising expression and regulation of genes in individual NVU cell-types in stroke hemisphere compared to the healthy contralateral hemisphere.
The Upset data can be visualized by going to http://vcg.github.io/upset, by pasting the json file link https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SGD2020/mcao/master/mcao.json in the load address databar.
The original transcriptomic dataset can be explored and analyzed at https://bioinformatics.mpi-bn.mpg.de/SGD_Stroke
